C++自动化测试的几个框架

https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2
> Catch2 is mainly a unit testing framework for C++, but it also provides basic micro-benchmarking features, and simple BDD macros.

https://github.com/google/googletest
> Google's C++ test framework!

https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html
> The ctest executable is the CMake test driver program. CMake-generated build trees created for projects that use the enable_testing() and add_test() commands have testing support. This program will run the tests and report results.
